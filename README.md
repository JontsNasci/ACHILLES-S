# ACHILLES-S
What's is this?

Achille-s is a generative machines and scientific projects with neural networks

## How to use it 

Project still closed alpha so don't expected much, we will continue update along the time
So, how to configure it and plug and play on your machine?

``Arxiv`` is our supply there are the core of the project, so if you want to generate something you need to feed the network with it in the variable ``diretorio`` there is the path to the files structure is very basically ``articles/article_name/abstract.txt`` and the main file that contains all article content so the PDF ``main.txt`` in the same folder

We can configure others variable and see something like ``config_classific`` the classification of the article generation health and the ``config_similarity`` how the prompt is similar to the response, so don't worry "play around with numbers on your own"

## How to setup agent
How can we setup the agent and plug and play the project, on variable ``path`` you can configure to path you want this path has to be compatible with **Machenary** path, then There you go!, if you configurate everything fine will run correctly.

## Why diffusion is not working

maybe the diffuser is not working but don't worry we don't need to worry, is a future implementation and very basic.
